It is best known for its thousands of flamingoes which nest along the shores of Lake Nakuru. The surface of the shallow lake is hardly recognizable due to the continually shifting mass of pink. The best vantage point is from <em>Baboon Cliff.</em>Also of interest is an area of 188km around the lake fenced off as a sanctuary to protect giraffes as well as both black and white rhinos. Other animals that can be found here are waterbucks, lions,pythons, cheetahs,leopards and over 400 bird species. The park marches for 12.1km on the south eastern boundary with Soysambu conservancy which is the only remaining wildlife corridor to Lake Naivasha.</p></div>
